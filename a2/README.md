How to test:

1. In a terminal window, run:

    ./test.sh

2. In a separate terminal window, run:

    java FileSender file-send.txt localhost 2105

It is important to run `test.sh` before running the `FileSender` class as it compiles the `FileSender.java` file.
When the file transfer is complete, check the first terminal window for the output.
